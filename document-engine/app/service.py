"""The convert -> edit -> convert pipeline.

This is the deterministic heart of the Document Engine. It takes an uploaded
file plus an already-validated OperationPlan and produces an edited file in the
requested output format, reporting exactly what changed.

Flow:
  1. Detect input format (docx | digital pdf).
  2. Normalize to DOCX (pdf -> docx, with scanned detection).
  3. Apply the validated plan deterministically (python-docx).
  4. Render to the target output format (default: same as input).
  5. Return the output path + a change summary.

No LLM calls occur here. The plan is produced upstream (Strands agent) and is
re-validated against the closed schema before it ever reaches this module.
