"""Deterministic executors for validated operations.

No LLM calls happen here. Given a validated `OperationPlan` and a DOCX file,
this module applies each operation with plain Python (python-docx) and reports
exactly what changed. Same input always produces the same output.

Design notes:
  - Text replacement preserves formatting. python-docx often splits a single
    visible word across multiple "runs" (formatting spans). We handle both the
    easy case (target within one run) and the hard case (target spans runs).
  - We walk paragraphs in the body, every table cell, and every header/footer
    so replacements are complete across the whole document.
  - `set_copies` never touches the document; it is print metadata returned to
    the caller.
