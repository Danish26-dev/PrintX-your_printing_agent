"""Native, in-place PDF text editing (layout-preserving).

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The PDF -> DOCX -> edit -> PDF round-trip (pdf2docx + LibreOffice) reliably
performs the text edit, but it RECONSTRUCTS the whole document. On real,
image-heavy, multi-column reports that reconstruction reflows content and can
change pagination substantially (measured: a 22-page NSS report rendered to
32-44 pages, with sections shifted and page dimensions altered).

This module edits the PDF *in place* instead: it finds the exact glyph span(s)
for the target text, removes only those glyphs (redaction), and draws the
replacement text on the SAME baseline using the original span's font size,
colour, and — when technically possible — the original embedded font. Images,
vector graphics, page size, and the number of pages are left untouched.

PAGE SCOPING
------------
`replace_text` may carry an optional inclusive, 1-based page range (`pages`).
When present, only occurrences on those pages are replaced; occurrences on any
other page are left unchanged. 1-based page numbers from the instruction are
converted to 0-based indexes here (documented at the conversion site).

TYPOGRAPHY
----------
Replacement text is placed at the original span's baseline origin (not a
rect-derived guess), so it sits on the same line as the surrounding text. We
insert the replacement string EXACTLY as given — no padding — so no extra
spaces are introduced before punctuation or between words. If the replacement
is wider than the space the original text occupied (so it would overlap the
following text), the occurrence is FLAGGED for review rather than silently
shrunk or allowed to overlap.

We never claim pixel-perfect fidelity. When the original embedded font cannot
be reused we fall back to a base-14 font that matches weight/style and record
that honestly in the result.

LICENSING
---------
Uses PyMuPDF (fitz), AGPL-3.0 (or commercial). PyMuPDF is already a dependency
of this engine. If PrintX is distributed as a hosted service, AGPL
source-availability obligations apply to the combined work — a product/legal
decision noted here for visibility.

# renders visually but corrupts the TEXT LAYER (measured: "Md Danish Ali"
# extracted back as "Md\xa0Danish\xa0Ali" and was no longer searchable). A
# correct, searchable, copyable, accessible text layer matters more than an
# exact glyph match, and validation + the user's "replacement present" checks
# rely on it. So we insert replacements with a base-14 font chosen to MATCH the
# original's weight/style and serif/sans family (e.g. Times for a serif
# original), at the same size and colour, and report the substitution honestly.
